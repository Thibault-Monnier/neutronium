## Setup

Clone this repository and set it up by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thibault-Monnier/neutronium.git
cd neutronium
chmod +x cmake-build.sh
chmod +x compile.sh
chmod +x run.sh
chmod +x test.sh
```

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build llvm
```

Make sure your `cmake` version is at least 3.28.

## Compile and Run

You can use the following scripts to compile and run the Neutronium compiler:

```bash
./configure_cmake.sh # Reconfigure cmake build files
./compile.sh <path-to-source-file> [OPTIONS] # Build the compiler, then compile a Neutronium source file
./run.sh <path-to-source-file> [OPTIONS] # Build the compiler, then compile and run a Neutronium source file
```

As of October 2025, the compiler always writes the generated executable to `neutro/out`.

> Tip: you can write your scripts in the scripts/ directory, which is ignored by version control.

## Run Tests

To build and run the test suite, run:

```bash
./test.sh
```
